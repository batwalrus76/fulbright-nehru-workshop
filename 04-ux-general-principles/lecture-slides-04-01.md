-------------------------------

# Put the User in the Center

[1]
- Listen to your users
- Have empathy for users, reduce your bias
- Take into account what users are strong and weak at
- If you are trying to target specific users then find proxies

-------------------------------

# Context is King

- Understand users' environments
- Why are students using your application?
- What are users' constraints?
- It might be helpful to emulate the user and see what you app is like

-------------------------------

# Users need control

- Allow users to clearly understand what they control
- Give them preferences for how the application looks
- If there is a common set of steps create a shortcut
- History and undo and redo, allow users to safely fail

[3]
-------------------------------

# Consistency

- The experience shouldn't change if inputs don't change
- Reuse components throught out a design
- Reuse patterns and frameworks that users like in other contexts
![bg right w:246 h:205](./images/iphone.jpg)
<!-- Make it easy to change all similar content uniformly -->
<!-- Use system controls as intended -->
[1]

-------------------------------

# A Simple Design is Often a Good Design

- Choose the simplest solution
  - Easier for users to grasp
  - Easier to maintain
- Less clutter helps with focus
- Tools should be as self-evident as possible

-------------------------------

# Other UX Principles

- Usability First
- Hierarchical Design
- Test Accessibility
- Never jump straight into a high-fidelity prototype
