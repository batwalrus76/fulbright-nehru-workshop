- Learn

-------------------------------

### The Five-Act Interview

1. Friendly welcome
2. Open-ended context questions about the customer
3. Intro to the prototype
4. Detailed tasks (prepared in advance) to see responses
5. Quick debrief
[1]

-------------------------------

### Friendly Welcome

- Make the interviewee feel comfortable
- Let them know that they will be recorded for the team to view
- In real life you would need a consent form
- Set up a Zoom or something and keep the dev team watching
[1]

-------------------------------

### Open-ended Context Questions about the Customer

- Have a natural conversation that is not clearly about the product
- Start by asking personal or non-technical questions
- Guide the conversation to your product, but never directly to it
- You want to understand where they are coming from, you are not selling them anything
[1]

-------------------------------

### Introduce the Prototype

- Make sure the interviewee knows that they are not being tested, "There are no wrong answers"
- Tell them to think out loud
- Talk generally about what the product does, don't create a plan of action for them
- Insure that they know that these are prototypes and that not everything will work perfectly
[1]

-------------------------------

### Tasks and nudges

- Give them a starting point, if possible make it relevant to their background
- Tell them what you would like them to do
- Try not to tell the interviewee how to do things, unless they are stuck or getting flustered
- You can nudge them, like "Oh I might look in the menu bar"
- Ask experiential questions during this stage, "What are you thinking of now?"
[1]

-------------------------------

### Quick Debrief

- How does this compare to what you normally do?
- Would you recommend this to your colleague?
- Which way worked for you?
- Give some pros and cons?

This should not be too long, just enough to get a clue of their general fealings about the product
[1]

-------------------------------

### Learn

- Watch together
- Take notes together
- Put notes on stickies on a board and give color marks (green = positive, red = negative)
- Find patterns by combining similar comments or responses
- If your prototype had a really positive response and still meets your initial goals +++
- If your prototype had negative responses, its still positive, because you didn't waste month of effort, maybe another week sprint? +++
