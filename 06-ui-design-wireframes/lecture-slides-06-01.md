-------------------------------

### What are wireframes

- "is a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a website...created for the purpose of arranging elements to best accomplish a particular purpose" [1]
- Think of it as the blueprint of how the whole or part of an application will be viewed by a user.
- Generally wireframes are done in a cartoonish or sketched style, remember the UX design principle to design at a lower fidelity than real world. [2]
- Wireframes can be combined in a hierarchical, sequential, or networked manner to show multistage or depth interactions.

- You can use buttons with linking functionality for navigation

- Photoshop/Illustrator
- Nice for combining screenshots of components to show best of breed
- Not built for interaction, so may be difficult to show navigation

### Purpose-built Applications

- Balsamiq
- Mockplus
- Wireframe
- Vary between simple and highly complex interfaces
- Some are cartoonish and others are highly detailed and focus on context/environment
- Lots of support for interactivity and navigation - note that visual and interactive fidelity are different
