# UI Reverse Engineering

1. Take a UI that you use frequently
2. Look at the main UI window
3. Sketch the highest level draw the main window and toolbar
4. Recursively draw where you think different windows and components exist
5. At each level photograph the current level drawing and put it on a slide
6. If you can recognize which components affect what happens in other components use a sticky or other way to note this interaction
