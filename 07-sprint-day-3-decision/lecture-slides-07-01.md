-------------------------------

### Heat Map

- Each person has the option to vote
- No rules on votes
- Your vote is on the parts of the various storyboard cells
[1]

-------------------------------

### Speed Critique

For each sketch:
- Spend 3 minutes
- Facilitator narrates the sketch and highlights standout ideas
- If anything is missed the team can call things out
- The Scribe attaches stickies with notes to the sketch
- At the very end, the sketch creator can identify anything that was missed
[1]

-------------------------------

### Straw Poll and Supervote

- Each person takes notes to describe their vote
- Everyone puts a dot on the part or the whole of the sketch that they are voting for
- Each person spends one minute decribing their vote
- The Decider listens to the team to help with their decision
- The Decider has three votes and anything with a supervote wins
[1]

-------------------------------

### Rumble

- If there is too disparate of choices, then you will have another round
- Each team member describes says their favorite and describes why, quickly
- Votes are tallied
- Decider decides, even in spite of votes
[1]

-------------------------------

### Storyboard

- Its the artists' time to shine, they are the focal point
- Go to a big whiteboard/wall, it will hold a 5x3 grid of 1-2 page boxes
- Choose a starting point (screen, CLI, etc.)
- Go from left to right, row by row, draw in a cell
[1]

-------------------------------

### Cells

- Cells are initialy sketches, important words
- Each cell is a major state, use stickies to indicate how state is changed
- Don't waste time on edits, just get the major points across
[1]

-------------------------------

### General Guidelines

- The whole storyboard should encapsulate the objectives from start to end.
- The decider in the end decides what goes on each cell
- Be a little risky
- The whole story should take 15 minutes
