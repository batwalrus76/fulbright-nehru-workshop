# Fulbright-Nehru Lectures
## 01 Agile Development Methods and Project Management


Chancellor T. Pascale
Fulbright-Nehru
Summer 2022

-------------------------------
## Software Development Processes

- Waterfall
- Modified Waterfall
- Scrum
- Spiral
- Agile

<!-- Software cannot be built like in the movies -->
<!-- Or at least software that lasts cannot be built with two people in a garage just typing away and drinking Red Bull -->
<!-- At some point, teams get larger, features become hard to track, and bugs become more common -->
<!-- The Software Development Life-Cycle and processes are meant to take and idea and move it to production -->

-------------------------------

## Waterfall

![Waterfall Model](./diagrams/waterfall.svg "Waterfall Model")

<!-- Classic methodology that worked well when software took years to develop -->
<!-- Not perfect for projects which have changing requirements or need quick MVP -->
<!-- Engineering overkill, can often spend so much time in early stages and left with two strategies, either push right or make dev short -->
<!-- Make sure to discuss the length of time from design to a working product -->

-------------------------------

## Modified Waterfall

![Modified Model](./diagrams/modified_waterfall.svg "Modified Waterfall Model")

<!-- Sort of close to spiral, which we will discuss later -->
<!-- Still has a lot of sequential structure, which may make more sense to parallelize -->

-------------------------------

## Scrum

![Scrum](./diagrams/scrum.png "Scrum Development Process") [1](https://blog.4geeks.io/scrum-for-digital-product-development/)
<!-- Came from Japanese carmakers such as Nissan and Mazda that needed to have factories and workers that could rapidly change what cars were being built -->
<!-- The idea of scrum comes from rugby, it is when the whole team comes together and then rapidly moves into action -->
<!-- This methodology has lots of structure/dogma and can be a bit much and too rigid -->

-------------------------------

## Spiral

![Spiral](./diagrams/spiral.jpg "Spiral Development Model") [2](https://eternalsunshineoftheismind.files.wordpress.com/2013/02/i-s-spiral.jpg)
<!-- Intended to remove some of the inflexibility of Scrum, but keep the periodicity of versions and meeting more frequently for shorter -->
<!-- Fairly modern and very much like modified waterfall, but more built around incrementalism and not as many steps -->

-------------------------------

## Agile

![Agile](./diagrams/agile.svg "Agile Model")
<!-- Less structured than shown, Reqs and analysis are at beginning and test/eval can be less rigorous. Development is given priority -->
<!-- This can be a catch all phrase for unstructured development. -->
<!-- Still need structure with flexibility, though can fall apart if team doesn't take it seriously or releases aren't aligned with requirements changes -->
