## 02 Team Creation


Chancellor T. Pascale
Fulbright-Nehru
Summer 2022

-------------------------------
# Team Creation

<style scoped>
ul { columns: 2; }
</style>
- Overall Goals
- Team Goals
- Team Roles
- General Schedule
- Intro to Google Sprint
- Development Sprint
- Test, Integration, and Documentation Sprint

<!-- This will be hectic and we will adapt, that will always be your best tool, your ability to adapt. -->

-------------------------------

# Overall Goals

- Learn real world Linux software development
- Develop prototype software
- Create software template for long-term project
- Learn UI/Linux-specific technical topics

<!-- Don't be overwhelmed, you can always do more than you think you can! -->
<!-- Also doing things properly is more important than doing them fast -->

-------------------------------

# Team Goals

- There will be 5 teams of approx. 9 team members
- Each will be responsible for specific components of software projects
- Each team will work independently
- Coordination will occur at a higher level

<!-- Communication is key and it needs to go up and down -->
<!-- Being professional is not being friends, but being cordial and being focused on maximizing everyone's impact -->
<!-- Coordination is important but making sure that what you have built lasts beyond these three weeks is more so, so if
you need to break something to make it work in the long run, do it early -->

-------------------------------

# UI Text Editor Components

1. Core - everything goes through this
2. File System - reading, writing, temp files
3. Menu Bar - File, Edit, View, etc.
4. Text Editor Window - Where user sees and modifies text

-------------------------------

# Team Roles

<style scoped>
ul { columns: 2; }
</style>

- Product Owner
- ScrumMaster
- Note Taker
- Graphic Designer
- Test Engineer
- Technical Writer
- Systems Administrator
- Designated User (Can be 2nd role for developer)

<!-- Choose what you are best at but you will not only be fulfilling that role -->
<!-- If we have more people than roles on a team, then split responsibilities or have a co-lead -->
<!-- The teams can decide to switch up roles throughout the 3 weeks, but don't waste time doing this -->

-------------------------------

# General Schedule

- Week 1 Google Sprint
- Week 2 Software Development Sprint
- Week 3 Test, Integration, and Documentation Sprint

<!-- The first sprint will focus on creating a long term plan/design, a good basis for future work but not the foundation of a building, things can change -->
<!-- Really focus on development in the 2nd week, but if it makes sense you can start on documentation, testing, and integration earlier -->
<!-- Continue developing in week 3, but you may do less feature development, and by the end, your software and artifacts should allow for further development -->

-------------------------------

# Intro to Google Sprint

- Takes 5 days
- Stresses prototype development
- Each team will have own sprint
- Designated Users for other teams and Professors will act as users
- Integration will occur after user testing

<!-- The Google Sprint is just one of many short term prototyping methodologies -->
<!-- It is a process and should be followed pretty closely -->
<!-- This is a collaborative effort, within and between teams -->
<!-- Don't be afraid to express yourself, no idea is a bad idea and may lead to breakthroughs -->

-------------------------------

# Software Development Sprint

- Daily scrum meeting
- Teams work independently
- Breaks for short technical lessons
- End of day Product Owners meetings
- Goal is to have a lot of working prototype code ready

<!-- We will have a pattern to each day, this will help us focus on the tasks at hand and know what happens when -->
<!-- Feel free to do whatever you need but avoid distractions -->
<!-- We will work to create minimal viable products at all times, demonstrate them and then integrate as often as possible -->

-------------------------------

# Test, Integration, and Documentation Sprint

- Daily scrum meeting
- Teams work mostly independently, but more integration
- Breaks for short technical lessons
- End of day Product Owners meetings
- Goal is to have integrated, tested, and documented prototype

<!-- Similar to the previous week, but we focus on making it easier to continue your work beyond these 3 weeks -->
<!-- You should be confident in what you created, rather than "crossing your fingers" each time you run the code -->
<!-- We will have competitions meant to focus your work, not distract you from your final goal -->

-------------------------------

# Let's make teams

- If anyone wants a role, when I ask raise your hand
- If you are interested in a component, when I ask raise your hand
- Otherwise, Other observers and myself will decide for you

<!-- I will switch back to roles slide and I will ask for people to fill roles and join teams, lets make this quick -->
<!-- Think about the role and consider if it makes sense for you, don't focus a lot on who you want to work with -->
<!-- Don't let others decide for you and this is not permanent -->
