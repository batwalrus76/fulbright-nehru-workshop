## Fulbright-Nehru Lecture 08 Component Reuse

Chancellor T. Pascale
Fulbright-Nehru
Summer 2022

-------------------------------

### Components-based Software Engineering

- "Component-based software engineering (CBSE) is an approach to software development that relies on the reuse of entities called ‘software components’" [1]
- The level above object-oriented development
- Collections of software with a single purpose or a singular view of data/state
- Components can be hierarchical or composited

-------------------------------

### Other Properties of CBSE

- Encourages decoupling
- Testing is easier as components can be done in isolation
- They can be managed separately, teams and repositories
- Interfaces are more important and should be well-documented

-------------------------------

### Types of Software Components

- User Interface - Windows, panes, menus, and buttons
- Visualization components - Tables, Graphs, Maps, and plots
- Services - APIs, RESTful, message queues, and sockets
- Data - Databases, Tables, Documents, and Streams

-------------------------------

### How to Manage Components

- Packages, modules, libraries, services, and repositories
- Interface documentation, such as UML, wikis, websites, and interactive (Swagger/OpenAPI) [2]
- Components = Teams
- Change Control Boards
- Unit and Integration Testing
